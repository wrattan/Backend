# Credentials Folder

## The purpose of this folder is to store all credentials needed to log into your server and databases. This is important for many reasons. But the two most important reasons is
    1. Grading , servers and databases will be logged into to check code and functionality of application. Not changes will be unless directed and coordinated with the team.
    2. Help. If a class TA or class CTO needs to help a team with an issue, this folder will help facilitate this giving the TA or CTO all needed info AND instructions for logging into your team's server. 


# Below is a list of items required. Missing items will causes points to be deducted from multiple milestone submissions.

2. SSH username
3. SSH password or key.
    <br> If a ssh key is used please upload the key to the credentials folder.
4. Database URL or IP and port used.

7. Database name (basically the name that contains all your tables)
8. Instructions on how to use the above information.
